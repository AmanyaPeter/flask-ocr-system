## Utilizing OCR Confidence Scores for Enhanced User Feedback

The application currently captures detailed OCR data, including word-level confidence scores, via `pytesseract.image_to_data(..., output_type=Output.DICT)`. This rich information is stored within the `results['pages'][...]['ocr_data']` structure. However, this detailed data, particularly the confidence scores, is not yet fully leveraged to provide nuanced feedback to the user about the OCR output quality.

### Current Data Handling

*   **Data Collection:** The `get_ocr_data` function correctly retrieves a dictionary (`ocr_data`) containing lists for recognized 'text', 'conf' (confidence scores), 'left', 'top', 'width', 'height' (bounding box coordinates), and other structural information for each detected word or text segment.
*   **Data Storage:** The full `ocr_data` dictionary is saved per page in the `results.json` file.
*   **Primary Text Display:** The main text shown to the user and used in downloads is an aggregation: `" ".join(ocr_data['text']).strip()`. This provides the full text but loses the word-specific confidence context in its direct presentation.

### Proposals for Leveraging Confidence Scores

The availability of word-level confidence scores (and bounding boxes) opens up opportunities to significantly improve the user experience by visually indicating the reliability of different parts of the OCRed text.

1.  **Visual Highlighting of Low-Confidence Words in Text Display:**
    *   **Concept:** When displaying the OCR results (e.g., in the `results.html` template), iterate through the words and their corresponding confidence scores from `ocr_data`. If a word's confidence is below a predefined threshold (e.g., 80%), it can be visually distinguished.
    *   **Implementation Idea (Conceptual for `results.html`):**
        *   The backend would pass the full `ocr_data` (or a processed version of it containing words and confidences) to the template.
        *   The template rendering logic (e.g., Jinja2) would loop through each word.
        *   Words could be wrapped in `<span>` tags with specific CSS classes based on their confidence level.
        *   Example:
            ```html
            {% for page in results.pages %}
                <div class="ocr-page-text">
                    {% for i in range(page.ocr_data.text | length) %}
                        {% set word = page.ocr_data.text[i] %}
                        {% set confidence = page.ocr_data.conf[i] | int %}
                        {% if word.strip() %} {# Only process actual words #}
                            {% if confidence != -1 and confidence < 80 %} {# -1 is often for non-word elements or skipped regions #}
                                <span class="low-confidence-word" title="Confidence: {{ confidence }}%">{{ word }}</span>
                            {% else %}
                                <span>{{ word }}</span>
                            {% endif %}
                            {{ " " }} {# Add space between words #}
                        {% endif %}
                    {% endfor %}
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
            ```
        *   **CSS Styling:**
            ```css
            .low-confidence-word {
                color: red; /* Or orange */
                text-decoration: underline dotted; /* Or background-color */
            }
            .low-confidence-word:hover {
                cursor: help;
            }
            ```
    *   **Benefits:** This immediately draws the user's attention to parts of the text that Tesseract was less certain about, guiding them to areas that may require manual review and correction.

2.  **Overall Confidence Metrics (Page/Document):**
    *   **Concept:** Calculate and display an average confidence score for each page or for the entire document.
    *   **Calculation:** This could be a simple average of all word confidences (ignoring -1 values, which often represent structural elements or empty spaces rather than actual word OCR attempts). More sophisticated metrics could weigh words by their length or importance.
    *   **Benefits:** Provides a quick, high-level understanding of the overall quality.
    *   **Caveat:** While easy to compute, an overall score can sometimes mask localized areas of very poor OCR. Word-level highlighting is generally more actionable for users.

3.  **Interactive Highlighting on Preview Image (Advanced):**
    *   **Concept:** Use the bounding box information (`left`, `top`, `width`, `height`) in conjunction with confidence scores to draw boxes or overlays directly onto the preview image. Low-confidence regions could be highlighted.
    *   **Implementation Idea:**
        *   This would require JavaScript on the client-side.
        *   The `ocr_data` (including bounding boxes and confidences) would be passed to the frontend.
        *   A library like Fabric.js or even custom HTML/CSS overlays could be used to draw rectangles on the image.
        *   When a user hovers over a highlighted box, the corresponding text and its confidence score could be shown.
    *   **Benefits:** Provides a very direct visual link between the original document's appearance and the OCR output's reliability. This is particularly useful for complex layouts or noisy images.

4.  **Confidence Threshold Configuration:**
    *   Allow users (perhaps via an advanced setting) to define the threshold below which words are highlighted. Different use cases might tolerate different levels of OCR uncertainty.

### How This Helps Users

*   **Guided Proofreading:** Users can focus their manual verification efforts on the parts of the text most likely to contain errors, saving significant time.
*   **Increased Trust:** Providing transparency about OCR certainty helps users understand the system's limitations and trust its output more when confidence is high.
*   **Informed Decisions:** Users can make more informed decisions about how to use the OCRed text based on its perceived accuracy.

By making use of the already collected confidence scores, the application can provide a much richer and more helpful experience for users, enabling them to work with OCR results more efficiently and effectively.
